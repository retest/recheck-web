--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1.13.0] (2022-03-08)
---------------------

### Breaking Changes

* Update Selenium version to > 4.0, this cause that you need also to update your Selenium version.

### Bug Fixes

* AutocheckingRecheckDriver now only calls `Recheck#cap()` if browser is closed.

### Improvements

* Update dependencies to fix bugs and security issues.


[1.12.0] (2021-06-24)
---------------------

### Breaking Changes

* Since 01.12.2020 this project is owned and developed by [UBS Hainer GmbH](https://ubs-hainer.com/).

### Bug Fixes

* Fix unchecked `ClassCastExceptions` when using the `Actions`-API with the `AutocheckingDriver`.
* Fix a bug with which, if the element is checked in isolation, some attributes can escape the scope and not be checked.
* AutocheckingRecheckDriver `driver.switchTo().activeElement().*` wasn't performing automatic checks.

### New Features

* Calling `driver.switchTo().window( name )` will now perform a check when using a `AutocheckingRecheckDriver`.
* Add Option to delay autochecking with AutocheckingRecheckDriver
* AutocheckingRecheckDriver now allows manual checks: `driver.check( final String action )`
* Upgrade to recheck version 1.12.0

### Improvements

* Always override the system metadata (i.e. on "architecture"), so that we do not end up with mixed info.
* Since `retestId` is now created deterministically, we can reference it before we even have a Golden Master. So if you know what the `retestId` will gona be (e.g. your element has a specific text, HTML ID or you have your own `RetestIdProvider`), you can already use it in the test. 


[1.11.1] (2020-07-08)
---------------------

### Bug Fixes

* Add `covered=false` as default attribute to reduce noise.
* Add `border-image-outset=0` as default


[1.11.0] (2020-05-15)
------------

### Breaking Changes

* Rename self-introduced property `tab-index` to `tabindex`, which is W3C standard.
* Add self-introduced property `covered`.
* Add `autofocus` as attribute (needs special handling).

### Bug Fixes

* `RecheckWebOptionsBuilder` now overrides all parent methods to return an instance of `RecheckWebOptionsBuilder`. Before that, using methods from the parent would effectively shadow methods from `RecheckWebOptionsBuilder`.

### New Features

* Introduce a `skipCheck()` method on `RecheckDriver`, `AutocheckingRecheckDriver`, and `UnbreakableDriver`, which is an alias for `getWrappedDriver()`, making it possible signal a clearer intent when writing tests.

### Improvements

* Keep the order of the HTML elements preserved in the underlying result (internal change), which makes a couple things easier.
* Change how covered elements are detected in order to handle rounded buttons


[1.10.3] (2020-03-16)
---------------------

### Bug Fixes

* Upgrade to recheck version 1.10.2


[1.10.2] (2020-03-11)
---------------------

### Bug Fixes

* Upgrade to recheck version 1.10.1


[1.10.1] (2020-03-06)
---------------------

### Bug Fixes

* Fix method `RecheckWebOptionsBuilder#checkNamingStrategy( AutocheckingCheckNamingStrategy )`was changed to `protected`. It is now `public` again.


[1.10.0] (2020-03-04)
---------------------

### Breaking Changes

* Add `shoot(WebDriver, WebElement)` in interface `ScreenshotProvider` to create screenshots for `WebElement`.
* Change constructor visibility of `RecheckWebOptions` and `RecheckWebOptions$Builder` from `public` to `protected`. Please use the corresponding builder accordingly.

### Bug Fixes

* Fix that `NoScreenshot` or `RecheckWebOptions#disableScreenshots()` is not applied to web elements.
* Fix that `de.retest.recheck.web.screenshot.provider` from `recheck.ignore` is ignored when `RecheckWebOptions` are used.
* Fix that passing an element into `RecheckWebImpl` from an `UnbreakableDriver` throws an error.
* Fix that `viewportOnly` points to `ViewportOnlyMinimalScreenshot` and adapt the default accordingly (`viewportOnlyMinimal`).
* Fix that `ActionbasedCheckNamingStrategy` could potentially throw an error.

### New Features

* Implement [#389](https://github.com/retest/recheck-web/issues/389)
    * All CSS selectors using attribute syntax are supported.
    * The pseudo class selectors: checked, disabled, and read-only are supported.

### Improvements

* Replace the internal dependency to [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) (which often caused trouble) with [SnakeYAML](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml).


[1.9.0] (2020-01-29)
--------------------

### Bug Fixes

* Fix that cascading frames inside of frames are not analyzed. Now depth doesn't matter...

### New Features

* Provide additional metadata: current URL
* Save the warnings identified by the `UnbreakableDriver` to the report to allow for healing of the test code.

### Improvements

* An exception is now thrown if explicit `Recheck#check` is called with an implicit `RecheckDriver`. This kind of mixing is not expected and therefore now prevented as it produced unexpected behavior due to both checks trying to find and create a Golden Master.
* Improve the breaking messages from a `UnbreakableDriver` to include more information like the line number.
* Add short cuts for screenshot enabling/disabling via the `RecheckWebOptions`.


[1.8.1] (2020-01-23)
--------------------

### Bug Fixes

* (Re)Established IE11 compatibility.


[1.8.0] (2019-12-13)
--------------------

### New Features

* As recheck gathers metadata, recheck-web will provide additional metadata:
    * Browser name and version.
    * Driver width and height.
    * Operating system and version if specified in the driver.

### Improvements

* `AutocheckingRecheckDriver` and thus the `RecheckDriver` now implement the `RecheckLifecycle`, meaning that they can be used with the JUnit extensions.
* Big screenshots create a lot of overhead in storing, transferring and processing. Since we need screenshots only for the user, we reduce that overhead by specifying a max width in pixel, to which the screenshot is resized. 


[1.7.0] (2019-11-21)
--------------------

### Breaking Changes

* The default of how screenshots are created has changed from full page to viewport only. These two options are now available to set globally via properties and per test individually via `RecheckWebOptions`.

### New Features

* Screenshot creation can now be configured via the `RecheckOptions` or globally via `de.retest.recheck.web.screenshot.provider`. 


[1.6.0] (2019-11-06)
--------------------

### Bug Fixes

* Fix `StackOverflowError` if a `WrapsElement` (e.g. `@FindBy`) is checked that throws an exception.
* Fix `NullPointerException` if the checked `WebElement` is not visible.

### New Features

* Option to skip checks with `AutocheckingRecheckDriver`.

```java
private AutocheckingRecheckDriver driver;
@Test
public void loginTest() throws Exception {
	driver.findElement( By.id( "username" ) ).skipCheck().sendKeys( "myuser" );
	driver.findElement( By.id( "password" ) ).skipCheck().sendKeys( "1234" );
	driver.findElement( By.id( "login-from" ) ).submit();
}
```


[1.5.1] (2019-09-23)
--------------------

### Bug Fixes

* Fix [#355](https://github.com/retest/recheck-web/issues/355) when an exception is thrown in JavaScript if the element has no parent. 


[1.5.0] (2019-09-12)
--------------------

### Improvements

* Check now also individual `WebElement`s, making recheck a "Jest for Java".
* Handle iFrames without id correctly.
* Autocheck also on actions on `Navigate`.
* Raise no exception of screenshot creation fails.
* Extend the `RecheckOptions` correctly with `RecheckWebOptions`.


[1.4.0] (2019-08-21)
